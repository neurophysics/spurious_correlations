Spurious correlations
=====================
Avoid spurious correlations between measures with power-law dynamics by using a non-parametric test for assessing significance.

Usage
-----
  - main function: `get_significance.m` for obtaining a p-value by the surrogate data procedure.
  - see `run_example.m` for how to run it.
  - see `plot_simulation_figures.m` for recreating the simulation figures 2a), 2b) and 2c) from the paper.
